# Messaging
After hearing more and more people talk about the benefits of GraphQL, I decided that a messaging app would be a cool way to try it out. Below is a demo of my progress after about 3 weeks of work. I'm excited about how much I got to learn while doing this and am excited to take a break from the project to focus on other topics. 

There's definitely still some improvements that have to be made, but think this was a good stopping point for a minute.
